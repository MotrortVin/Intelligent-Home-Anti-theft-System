# Intelligent-Home-Anti-theft-System
Since the world's first intelligent building appeared in the United States in 1984, the United States, Canada, Europe, and other developed countries have proposed various smart home solutions. Currently, the main market for smart homes in China is still some high-end markets: villas ( Retail, engineering), intelligent community (engineering), but the ordinary residential smart home (retail) market has developed very slowly. For ordinary people, the complex functions of smart homes bring high cost of use, and how to reduce costs is the main direction of smart home systems in the future. In this context, we use Schneider Electric platform and simple sensors (pressure sensors, photoelectric sensors, Temperature sensor, etc.)to simulate the realization of smart home anti-theft system, using touch screen such simple human-computer interaction interface for information transmission Itâ€™s cost-effective, easy to implement, equipment plasticity, high expandability. Ultimately, we realize anti-theft alarm, high temperature alarm and the system has a good performance of hidden danger prevention.
